    While Thomas Kuhn's theory of scientific revolutions does not
    specifically deal with validation, the validation of simulations can
    be related in various ways to Kuhn's theory: 1) Computer simulations
    are sometimes depicted as located between experiments and theoretical
    reasoning, thus potentially blurring the line between theory and
    empirical research. Does this require a new kind of research logic
    that is different from the classical paradigm which clearly
    distinguishes between theory and empirical observation? I argue that
    this is not the case. 2) Another typical feature of computer
    simulations is their being ``motley'' \citep{winsberg:2003} with
    respect to the various premises that enter into simulations. A
    possible consequence is that in case of failure it can become
    difficult to tell which of the premises is to blame. Could this issue
    be understood as fostering Kuhn's mild relativism with respect to
    theory choice? I argue that there is no need to worry about relativism
    with respect to computer simulations, in particular. 3) The field of
    social simulations, in particular, still lacks a common understanding
    concerning the requirements of empirical validation of simulations.
    Does this mean that social simulations are still in a pre-scientific
    state in the sense of Kuhn? My conclusion is that despite ongoing
    efforts to promote quality standards in this field, lack of proper
    validation is still a problem of many published simulation studies and
    that, at least large parts of social simulations must be considered as
    pre-scientific.
